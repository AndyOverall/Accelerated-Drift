# Accelerated-Drift
Simulation code use in manuscript "Accelerated Drift in Age Structured Populations: Implications for Mutation Accumulation"
Running the files Figure1A.m, Figure1B.m, Figure1C and Figure2.m generates Figures 1A, 1B, 1C and 2, respectively.

The .mat files matlab2A.mat, matlab3A.mat and matlab4A.mat are a particular result of running 
the three simulation files in the folder Simulations_Of_Data.

Running the file GeneratesFigure3.m produces Figure 3.

Running the files GeneratesFigure4A.m, GeneratesFigure4B.m and GeneratesFigure4C.m
produces Figures 4A, 4B and 4C, respectively.
